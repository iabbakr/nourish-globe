      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Halima Sadiya Ahmad, a woman raised in a traditional household within a hunger and poverty hotspot. Inspired to make a difference, I pursued a degree in agriculture and founded Nourish Group to empower women and reshape agriculture into a tool for social change.
      </p>

        Today, Nourish Group impacts thousands of women and farmers through sustainable solutions, climate resilience, and community development.
